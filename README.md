# ENG_Dictionnary

A C language program that detects all misspelled words in an English text. For this purpose, a dictionary will be used, which will be built from a text or a set of reference words.



**Prerequisites:**
- gcc


**How to run**
Please put the text to be corrected in the file "texte.txt".                        
Please put the reference dictionary in the file "dico.txt".                 

`make mrproper`                                         
`make`                                                 
`./executable`


**Example**

Let's take the following text:
>In the old days ants and cicadas were friends They were very different The ants were hardworking but the cicadas were lazy
>In the summer the ant families were very busy They knew that in the winter they would have to stay in their anthill They wanted to have enough food for the whole winter
